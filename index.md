## Kathryn (Katy) Hinkelman, Ph.D.
Postdoctoral Scholar, Sustainable Buildings and Societies Laboratory <br />
Department of Architectural Engineering <br />
Pennsylvania State University <br />

**Contact:** khinkelman(at)psu(dot)edu

[**Curriculum Vitae**](KHinkelman_CV.pdf) 


### Background

Dr. Kathryn Hinkelman has a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Denver, 
an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, 
and a Ph.D. in Architectural Engineering from Pennsylvania State University. 
She is a recipient of the U.S. Department of Energy IBUILD Fellowship, 
the international P.E.O. Scholar Award, and Phi Beta Kappa. 
Before her doctoral studies, Kathryn worked at the Boulder Engineering Company, 
where she designed electrical and mechanical systems for multi-family residential 
and commercial buildings across the United States. 
Her research focuses on modeling and simulation of building and district energy 
systems and controls, to improve active systems deployed today and design innovative 
biomimetic solutions for future sustainable and resilient communities. 
She is an expert in Modelica, and over a dozen of her models have been publicly 
released in LBNL’s Modelica Buildings Library and the IBPSA Modelica Library. 
These libraries are part of the U.S. Department of Energy's next generation tools for advanced
building energy modeling and simulation.


### Research Interests

Sustainable energy systems (cities, districts, buildings), thermal-fluid science, 
equation-based modeling (Modelica), numerical simulation, biomimicry/bio-inspired design, 
human centered design, life cycle assessment, building controls, design thinking
