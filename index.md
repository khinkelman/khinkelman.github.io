[**Curriculum Vitae**](KHinkelman_CV.pdf) 


### Background

Katy received a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Denver in 2013, 
where she also played for the university’s D1 women’s soccer program. At DU, she graduated 
Summa Cum Laude with departmental distinction, was elected into the Phi Beta Kappa society 
for excellence in the liberal arts and sciences, and was named First Team COSIDA Academic 
All-American for Women’s Soccer in the 2011-12 season. In 2015, she received her M.S. degree 
in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. Her master’s research 
focused on the environmental impact analysis and co-design of culturally-centered homes with 
a California Native American tribe, the Pinoleville Pomo Nation. Before starting her doctoral 
studies, Katy worked at the Boulder Engineering Company for three years where she designed 
electrical and mechanical systems for multi-family residential and commercial buildings across 
the United States. Katy received her Ph.D. in Architectural Engineering from the Pennsylvania
State University in 2023. Her doctoral research focused on modeling and simulation of community-scale 
energy systems using the Modelica language, including traditional district heating and cooling 
systems and innovative biomimetic (nature imitating) designs for future sustainable and 
resilient communities. 


### Research Interests
